Everything below is a readme of the original, maybe i'll change it.... probably not. But I guess this is a great way to credit him. :D

# N20RefreshRateControl

XDA Page - https://labs.xda-developers.com/store/app/jdros.n20.refresh

Simple app to change N20/N20 Ultra Refresh rate (Adaptive 96Hz/Adaptive 120Hz) without ADB. Thanks to Max Weinbach for finding this tweak and Rohit Shetty for testing the S20 version of this app made by SatySatsZB.

This app also includes 2 qs tiles for setting 96Hz and 120Hz. Check in your quick settings panel to add them.

Info: This app targets older android sdk in order to set refresh rates without ADB requirement. Ignore the dialog that says "This app was built for an older version of Android...."
